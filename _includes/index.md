The Fanwood Green Team was established to work with Sustainable Jersey and maintain the borough's Bronze status.  Over the past few years the Fanwood Green Team has encouraged community involvement in green initiatives under the guidelines of Sustainable Jersey.

Through a grant from Sustainable Jersey, Margaret Chowdhury worked with the SPF school district and presented “Man’s Impact on the Environment” to seventh graders.Also as part of this grant a community presentation was given on creating a rain garden for Fanwood residents.  Rain Gardens are beneficial to mitigate storm water runoff.

Another element to the grant was done by Business consultant, Nikolai Chowdhury, who conducted a seminar and several webinars on sustainability practices available for the business community. 

On July 23, 2016 the Fanwood Green Team hosted the first Green Fair on the grounds of borough hall.

Recently, the Fanwood Green Team was featured in the Suburban News, with students from TCNJ volunteering in the Fanwood Nature Center:

Most recently, Fanwood was awarded a volunteer grant from Sustainable Jersey to help remove invasive plants from the Fanwood Nature Center.  This is an ongoing concern of the Fanwood Environmental Commission as well as the Fanwood Green Team.
